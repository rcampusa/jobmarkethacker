I am writing to express my interest in the position of \Position. I am an applied microeconomist specializing in Urban and Real Estate Economics, Entrepreneurship, and Industrial Organization. In the summer of 2022, I expect to complete my Ph.D. in Management with a concentration in Economic Analysis and Policy from the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto.

% Here, we begin custom sections. Each if/then will allow for a custom section depending on the type of job.

% The first custom job is for academic economics position (econ_academic)

\ifthenelse{\equal{\CoverLetterCat}{econ_academic}}{%
In my job market paper, \emph{Startup Location, Local Spillovers and Neighborhood Sorting}, I use data on the universe of firms in large Canadian cities to study how critical the spatial concentration of economic activity is for startups' success. The primary identification challenge in this setting is location sorting. I combine structural methods and machine learning algorithms with detailed firm, entrepreneur, and spatial data to account for sorting in two steps: across blocks within and between neighborhoods. I find strong causal evidence that exposure to more productive (proxied by revenue or employment) incumbent firms in the same industry has economically significant effects on startup end-of-year revenue, employment, and survival rates. However, these effects are hyper-local, mostly fading away after 75 meters, and are heterogeneous across industries. Firms operating in employment-intensive industries benefit relatively more from exposure to firms with more employees, while knowledge-intensive industries benefit relatively more from exposure to firms with higher revenue.

During graduate school, I have gained extensive experience as a teaching assistant for a broad range of classes at the undergraduate and MBA levels. Through these roles, I further developed the communication and teaching skills necessary to provide a stimulating and engaging learning environment for students. I believe these experiences give me the foundation to teach a wide variety of undergraduate and graduate courses, including Urban and Real Estate Economics, Data Analysis, Microeconomics, Econometrics, International Trade, and Industrial Organization.

I have complemented these skills with extensive experience as a teaching assistant for a broad range of classes at both the undergraduate and MBA levels. While I enjoyed my experience in graduate school and meet the requirements to succeed in academia, I prefer collaborative, dynamic, and fast-paced environments, which is why I have a strong preference for industry positions.
